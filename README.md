The 1 Hour Shop was a very early personal project of mine to see how quickly I could construct a functional online shopping webapp incorporating SpringMVC, SQL, and minimal CSS. The application is structured in such a way that one can easily add or remove items from the database, keeping the shop up to date. Requires a compand line program to run.
